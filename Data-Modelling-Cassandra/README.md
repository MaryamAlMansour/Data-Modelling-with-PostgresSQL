# Sparkify Using Cassandra

This Project will follow the same guidelines as Postgres Sparkify except it will model data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. Transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.

## Execution of Cassandra Sparkify
The same output will be delivered through running jupyter notebook step by step.
